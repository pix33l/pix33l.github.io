I’m a UI/UX designer with over 10 years of experience. I worked for big Internet companies(Alibaba, Netease), but now I’m starting my own business, working on everything from digital product production to running e-commerce stores.

Now I prefer to call myself a digital designer, focusing on designing web design, UI/UX design, logo/icon design for digital media.
